The field index is a\ndata structure which can locate key values in a fast way, which is very\npopular in database systems and computer systems. In addition, the field index\nis able to access certain specific keys in a fast way. Generally, the field\nindexes employ the B-tree index or B-tree index derivative data structure.\nSince traditional field indexes cannot manage with the fast locating the\nspatial data that is spatially related, spatial indexes are necessary to\nimprove the access speed of spatially related data.</p>\n<p>SuperMap provides spatial indexes which are only applicable to vector datasets\nincluding Quadtree index, R-tree index, tile index, dynamic index, and native\nindexes of some databases.</p>\n<p>A quadtree is a data structure that encodes spatial data using optimized\nHilbert codes and saves data and the index together. R-tree is an extension of\na B-tree in multiple dimensions, is highly efficient in searching, and saves\nspatial data and index data separately. While a tile index applies to divided\nmap data. Focus on database engines, SuperMap GIS introduces the dynamic index\nto exert searching abilities to databases.</p>\n<p>The created native indexes belong to spatial indexes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"gatsby-code-text\"><code class=\"gatsby-code-text\">* In PostGIS, a desktop will create a GIST index which is a general and balancing tree data structure and speeds up the retrieval of spatial data at the cost of additional storage space and creating time.\n* A 2dsphere index supports queries that calculate geometries on a sphere and supports all MongoDB geospatial queries. </code></pre></div>\n<p>A dataset can have only one type of spatial index at the same time. The\ncurrent spatial index of a dataset will be automatically maintained if the\ndataset is being edited. The indexing efficiency might be negatively affected\nafter several times of editing. Therefore, you need to rebuild the spatial\nindex.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Table 1: Indexes Supported By Engine Types Engine Type</th>\n<th>R-tree index</th>\n<th>Q-tree index</th>\n<th>Dynamic index</th>\n<th>Tile index</th>\n<th>Native indexes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>UDB</td>\n<td>Y (Applicable to all types of datasets)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SQLPlus</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PostgreSQL</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OraclePlus</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OracleSpatial</td>\n<td>Y (Applicable to all types of datasets)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KingBase</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MySQL</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DB2</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BeyonDB</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GBase</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to CAD dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Altibase</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to 2D/3D point and tabular dataset)</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PostGIS</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Y (GIST index)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MongoDB</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>Y (Not applicable to route dataset)</td>\n<td>Y (2dsphere index)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spatial Index Types","next":null,"prev":null},"fields":{"path":"content\\tutorial\\DataProcessing\\DataManagement\\SpatialIndexType.en.md","slug":"/en/tutorial/DataProcessing/DataManagement/SpatialIndexType/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/en/tutorial/DataProcessing/DataManagement/SpatialIndexType/"}}}
