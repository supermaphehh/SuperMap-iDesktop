You can add or delete ruler lines and modify their positions and types as your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Display scale</strong>: Specify the minimum and maximum display scale of your layout window. For example, if you set the Min Scale as 10%, when the layout window is zoomed out to 10%, it can not be smaller. Similarly, when you set the Max Scale as 120%, when the layout window is zoomed in to 120%, it can not be bigger. The minimum display scale is 1% and the maximum display scale is 1000%.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Grid Settings</strong>: Set whether to show grids, whether to capture grids ans intervals between grids. Grids can help you to set positions of layout elements exactly and they can not be printed out.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Horizontal/Vertical interval</strong>: Specify the intervals between grids inn horizontal direction and vertical direction. Unit: 0.1 millimeter.</li>\n<li><strong>Grid Snap</strong>: Capture grids automatically to help you position the precise location when you draw map elements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Background</strong>: Specify background for layout window and it is also the background of the paper which you print out. </li>\n<li><strong>Text Overlaying Display</strong>: When there are a lot of texts in the layout window, overlays between texts maybe appear. And so, the Text Overlaying Display checkbox is used to control whether texts overlaid by other texts are shown up. If you do not check it, objects added later will be filtered out by system automatically. But if you check it, all texts will be shown up.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Layout Settings","next":null,"prev":null},"fields":{"path":"content\\tutorial\\Layout\\Basic\\layoutSetting.en.md","slug":"/en/tutorial/Layout/Basic/layoutSetting/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/en/tutorial/Layout/Basic/layoutSetting/"}}}
